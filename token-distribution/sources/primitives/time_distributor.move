/// `TimeDistributor` is component that locks a `Balance<T>` and then distributes it over time to
/// multiple (arbitrary) members where each member recieves a share proportional to its "weight".
///
/// For example, if the distributor has a balance of 100 with an unlock rate of 10 per second and 2 members with
/// wieghts of 100 and 300, the the duration of the distribution will be 10 seconds and the members
/// will recieve 25 and 75 of the original balance respectively.
///
/// The difference between this module and `accumulation_distributor` is that here the distribution balance is
/// pre-allocated and distributed over time using the internal `time_locked_balance` continueously instead of
/// being distributed using manual top-ups discretely. Also, since member weights are all stored in the distributor
/// object, any member weight can be modified by the holder of the distributor object (but this also means there's
/// a limit to the number of members since most of the operations are `O(n)`).
///
/// This module doesn't implement any permission functionality and it's intended to be used as a
/// building block for other modules.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```
/// // create time distributor
/// let td = td::create<SUI, ID>(balance, 10);
/// let id: ID = <...>;
/// td::add_member(&mut td, id, 100, clock);
/// td::change_unlock_per_second(&mut td, id, clock);
///
/// // after some time... member withdraw
/// let balance = member_withdraw_all(&mut td, &id, clock);
/// ```
