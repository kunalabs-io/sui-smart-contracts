/// `Farm` is essentially a wrapper around `TimeDistributor` and implements permission functionality
/// on top of it with composability and flexibility in mind.
///
/// It's intended to be used with `Pool` (from the `token_distribution::pool` module) to enable yield farming
/// functionality where an amount of coins is allocated to be distributed across multiple different
/// pools in each of which any number of participants can deposit tokens to recieve a share of the
/// rewards (similar to liquidity mining functionality pioneered by SushiSwap and then implemented by
/// many other DeFi platforms also).
///
/// Nonetheless, it is not required to use this module with `Pool`. In order to add a member to a `Farm`,
/// one creates a `FarmMemberKey` (anyone is allowed to create it), and then an admin can add this key
/// to a `Farm` and adjust its weight. The owner of `FarmMemberKey` has the authority to withdraw
/// rewards distributed for that key. This setup allows for any custom implementation of `Pool` to
/// transparently work with this module.
///
/// A `FarmMemberKey` can be a member of multiple `Farms` at once and there is support for enforcing
/// atomic withdrawals from all the farms the key is a member of (implemented via the
/// `MemberWithdrawAllTicket` hot potato struct). This allows for `Pools` to distribute rewards
/// of multiple different token types simultaneously.
///
/// Usage:
/// ```
/// let (farm, admin_cap) = farm::create(balance, 1670758154, ctx);
///
/// let key = farm::create_member_key(ctx);
/// farm::add_member(&admin_cap, &mut farm, &mut key, 100, clock);
/// farm::change_unlock_per_second(&admin_cap, &mut farm, 50, clock);
///
/// /// some time later...
/// let balance = farm::mebmer_withdraw_all(&mut farm, &mut key, clock);
